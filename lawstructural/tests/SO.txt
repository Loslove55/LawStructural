I've noticed that every once in a while, someone will write a class in python along these lines

    class Example(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self.x = 5
        
        def some_method(self):
            # Do stuff to self.x
        
        def get_results(self):
            return self.x

My question is concerning the 'get_results' method, which seems superfluous to me since 'self.x' can be accessed directly with 'instance_name.x'. Is there a reason why this approach would be necessary/preferable? Is it an artifact of a programmer's experience with other languages?
